You are a financial analyst. Based on the following context, generate 3 specific market scenarios
(Base Case, Bull Case, Bear Case) for the requested analysis.

User Query: "{{ query }}"

Market Regime: {{ market_regime | tojson(indent=2) }}
Macro Indicators: {{ macro_indicators | tojson(indent=2) }}
{% if plan_context %}
Current Portfolio Context: {{ plan_context | tojson(indent=2) }}
{% endif %}

For each scenario, provide:
1. A weight (probability) - must sum to 1.0
2. 'drift_adj': A drift adjustment factor (e.g. 0.05 for +5% annual return boost, -0.05 for -5%)
3. 'vol_adj': A volatility adjustment factor (e.g. 0.2 for +20% volatility increase)
4. Description of the scenario logic.

Format strictly as JSON with keys: "scenarios" -> Ticker -> Case Name.
Use "GLOBAL" as ticker key if scenarios apply to all assets, or specific tickers like "SPY" if specific.
