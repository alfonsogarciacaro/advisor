{{ issues_data | tojson(indent=2) }}

Current allocation:
{{ optimal_weights | tojson(indent=2) }}

Key metrics:
- Expected Annual Return: {{ expected_annual_return }}
- Annual Volatility: {{ annual_volatility }}

Suggest 2-3 specific constraints to improve this portfolio. For each constraint, provide:
- type: One of "asset", "sector", "diversification"
- description: Clear explanation of the constraint
- specific_value: The actual value (e.g., 0.20 for 20% max weight)

Focus on practical constraints that a long-term investor would understand.
