# Agent Rules

## Python Dependencies and Execution
- **ALWAYS** use `uv` for Python dependency management and execution from `backend/` directory.
- Use `uv add <package>` to add dependencies.
- Use `uv run <script>` to execute Python scripts.
- Do NOT use `pip` or `python` directly unless absolutely necessary.
